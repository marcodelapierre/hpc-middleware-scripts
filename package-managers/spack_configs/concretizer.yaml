concretizer:
  # Whether to consider installed packages or packages from buildcaches when
  # concretizing specs. If `true`, we'll try to use as many installs/binaries
  # as possible, rather than building. If `false`, we'll always give you a fresh
  # concretization. If `dependencies`, we'll only reuse dependencies but
  # give you a fresh concretization for your root specs.
  reuse: false
  # When "true" concretize root specs of environments together, so that each unique
  # package in an environment corresponds to one concrete spec. This ensures
  # environments can always be activated. When "false" perform concretization separately
  # on each root spec, allowing different versions and variants of the same package in
  # an environment.
